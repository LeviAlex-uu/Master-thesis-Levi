Use the following format for the quadruples: {Label: name of label, Match: name of match, Ontology: ontology file name, Score: similarity score} If no label is semantically similar enough return the quadruple like this: {Label: name of label, Match: noMatch, Ontology: noMatch, Score: 0}  Sometimes similar labels can occur twice in the input, make sure to return one quadruple for each label in the input, for example if ten labels are provided return ten quadruples.  Here are some example mappings:
Input: Consumption for mechanical ventilation after 
Anwser: {Label: Consumption for mechanical ventilation after , Match: EnergyConsumptionProperty, Ontology: EnershareProperty, Score: 1}
Input: Total primary energy factor - for hot water preparation 
Anwser: {Label: Total primary energy factor - for hot water preparation , Match: EnergyConsumptionProperty, Ontology: EnershareProperty, Score: 1}
Input: CO2 emission factor for cooling 2 
Anwser: {Label: CO2 emission factor for cooling 2 , Match: EmissionConversionFactor, Ontology: EnershareSystem, Score: 1}
Input: Energy carrier for hot water preparation 
Anwser: {Label: Energy carrier for hot water preparation , Match: noMatch, Ontology: noMatch, Score: 1}
Input: Energy consumption for hot water preparation in KWH/M2 per year 
Anwser: {Label: Energy consumption for hot water preparation in KWH/M2 per year , Match: HeatingElectricEnergyConsumptionProperty, Ontology: EnershareProperty, Score: 1}
  Remember to only return the quadruples as a response nothing else. Complete the task with the following labels:

GearboxOilInletTemperature_val
GearboxOilInletPressure_val
HssGearBearingGenSideTemperature_val
GearboxRotationSpeed_val
GearboxOilPumpPressure_val
