The label will come from the ENERSHARE project, a project that seeks to improve data interoperability in the energy sector.
The project contains multiple pilots, below are descriptions of the purpose of each pilot, use this information as extra context during the task.

Pilot 1:
This pilot aims to foster data driven innovation in the onshore and offshore wind energy industry, along its value chain. The scope in this use case is to design and develop an offshore wind digital platform, for enabling the federated data sharing and ML based services between data owners and data users. The platform will be based on IDS architecture and include the design and development of IDSA connectors in the edge in addition to cloud-based services.

It will include the design and development of an integrated monitoring strategy for predictive maintenance of electrical drivetrain components, more specifically the generator (DFIG/permanent magnet technology) and the power converter, as well as the gearbox and pitch system of wind turbines. It will consist of a combination of data-driven models with physical models of the generator, gearbox, hydraulic pitch system and  potentially of the power converter into an integrated digital twin strategy. Normality models and a set of potential failure conditions will be developed. Both low frequency SCADA data (10-min) and higher frequency data (kHz range) if available, as well as maintenance/failure reports will be used. The application of edge computations in the models will be analysed.

The proposed case consists in providing a novel method based on ML algorithms to detect anomalies on several wind turbine subsystems (generator, gearbox, hydraulic pitch system and power converter) and identify their possible root causes. To do so, the SCADA data from onshore and offshore wind farms are used to construct fault detection and diagnostics algorithms.
In this context, classic anomaly detection approaches are doomed to be ineffective to point out sensor measurements responsible for the failure. Moreover, these models are generally not straightforwardly interpretable to humans. To cope with these problems, a two-phases anomaly detection algorithm will be implemented:
1. The first step aims to learn an anomaly detection model based on SCADA data (10mn time-step). 
2. In the second step, we develop an original approach to interpret anomaly results returned by the model in order to provide important insights about what deviation caused the anomaly.
It is important to emphasize that, beyond the wish to use a two-step algorithm to discover the main causes of the anomaly, there is also the intent to validate the anomalies, help decision-making, and optimize the planning of maintenance measures.
For wind turbine condition monitoring cloud services will be used together with edge computing.

Pilot 3:
In the context of aggressive climate targets set by global economies, the heating sector faces the greatest challenge in CO2 emissions. To meet energy efficiency and emissions reduction targets, district heating networks, the use of heat pumps and seasonal heat storage have been identified as measures with the greatest potential to increase energy flexibility. This opens up the possibility of increasing the share of renewable energy by coupling the heat and power sectors through balancing the cross-energy systems. The goal of the use case is to provide decision support at the individual user, heat/electricity utility, or community level through data aggregation, pre-processing, visualization, and analytic services.

To achieve this, the use case will apply:
1. Data aggregation, pre-processing and visualization to evaluate applicability and plan adoption of measures to meet the forecasted energy demand and their impact.
2. Data analytics to populate the future store with contextual and behavioural data.
3. Assess the flexibility potential of the electric system through the data analytics of system-level electricity data related to heating and cooling demands, distributed heating operational and forecast data, and data on renewable energy potential and climate targets. The goal is to plan actions to valorize heat flexibility across different actors while maintaining digital sovereignty.
4. The platform will focus on expanding the unique set of innovative methodological approaches and tools for coordinated planning of cross-sector interactions in order to secure demand and achieve climate targets.

The introduced innovative methodological approaches and tools presented will enable cities, local communities, and energy system operators to take an important step forward in energy planning, ensure reliable and secure supply, and ensure a high quality of life. Furthermore, this will support the transition to the fourth generation of district heating systems characterized by: i) digitalization, ii) decentralization and iii) improved energy efficiency through the use of energy flexibility across sectors. 

Pilot 4:
This use case will develop TwinP2G, a digital twin (DT) platform, for enabling the design and sharing of simulation based experiments based services between two main personas: data scientists (DEPA experts) and end-users (DEPA executives). 
Initially, a digital combined simulation and optimization platform, named TwinP2G, coupling the electricity transmission system with natural gas demands, leveraging a DT architecture that will enable multi-resolution simulations involving P2G technologies and hydrogen fuel cells. TwinP2G will enable data- and simulation-driven P2G and RHFC optimal planning leveraging RES surplus for green hydrogen production via electrolysis. The simulator will compose of 5 main components:
1. A data warehouse integrating external data through IDSA connectors where possible. Data will initially originate from IPTO  (electrical power demand, RES generation, long-term grid planning, electrical grid topologies), DESFA  (hourly / daily gas flows at entry and exit points, natural gas grid topologies) and other organizations (e.g. Eurostat , local and national grid topologies etc.)
2. A simulation and optimization platform (DT core) involving physics- and data- driven simulations accompanied by optimization capabilities. PyPSA (short-term simulation) and OSeMOSYS (long-term simulation) are examined as the main technologies of interest here. This components also leverages gas demand and electricity generation and load forecasts to empower its simulations.
3. A forecasting toolkit developed within the I-NERGY H2020 project and further developed within EnerShare that is developed following the MLOps principles. The forecasting component will feed the DT core with gas demand and electricity generation and load forecasts.
4. A front-end that serves the main user roles (personas): a data scientist (coding and modelling expert) and an energy engineer (deep understanding of energy systems but limited coding skills). The first persona will leverage a coding platform (subcomponent 1) to develop and share their experiments while the second will leverage a visualization engine (tightly related to Task 6.5 â€“ subcomponent 2) to visualize the results of the experiments in question.

Pilot 5:
The consumption of electricity strongly depends on the behaviour and habits of end users, and the demand is pratically completely inelastic. This electricity demand curve fits poorly with renewable generation, which is centred in the central hours of the day and is highly dependent on climate. As a consequence the electrical grid is subjected to voltage fluctuations and the reversal of power flows, which can lead to grid faults.
In order to increase the share of renewable energy, it was therefore thought to smartly manage the energy demand so as to bring it closer to the renewable generation curve: this process is called Demand Side Management. The widespread use of real-time sensors, fast data transmission and the presence of a SCADA system makes it possible to build a system that can show users what their consumption is and provide advice on how to better manage electrical loads, save money and benefit the environment.
The active involvement of users has the advantage of creating a culture of awareness of their impact on the environment and their spending, as well as enabling their participation in demand response programmes, so as to support the electricity grid in times of need.
End users can, once aggregated, provide ancillary services to the electricity grid, such as voltage support and frequency regulation; these services are activated on demand, when the grid is in an emergency or alarm condition.
It is therefore intended to assess how the use of electricity demand management, governed by a demand aggregator, can help the grid to manage peak power and reverse flows. An aggregator is an economic entity that involves users and acts as an intermediary between them and the distribution system operator. Users are incentivised to participate for environmental reasons, e.g. by visualising the reduction of electricity losses from the grid, or the increase of locally consumed renewable energy, or for economic reasons with dynamic price variation.  

Pilot 6:
The concept is based on data-driven energy management algorithms of flexible consumption. We aim to exploit the ever-increasing prevalence of EVs by utilizing their batteries and charging behavior and client preferences to provide balancing services to help stabilize grid frequency and create value for both vehicle owners and grid operators. 
This pilot will focus on 3 aspects: The first phase focuses on building up a tool allowing for the participation of distributed EV chargers as flexible consumptions in frequency control. The second phase focuses on the aggregation of available distributed flexibility from the consumers while respecting their priorities and preferences. 
The third phase will go one step further to incorporate many different types of flexible consumptions (e.g., heat pumps, residential batteries, and V2G) in combination with rooftop solar panels into the algorithm. Additionally, an algorithm will be developed for the optimal nomination of flexibility in ancillary services markets with a gate closure at D-2 and D-1.

Pilot 7:
The aim of this pilot is to create a solid framework through cross-sectoral integration of  data  on financial performance of energy efficiency projects. 
The scope is to strengthen debt and equity financing of energy efficiency investments, providing investors and project developers the opportunity to easily evaluate key performance indicators of future projects. 
Besides traditional AI-based green financing analytics services, in the context of this pilot the evaluation of energy data sharing to other sectors and the exploitation of how this pilot concept should evolve to become a more generic data sharing solution will be further investigated.
