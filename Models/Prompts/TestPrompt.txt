Use the following format for the quadruples:
{Label: name of label, Match: name of match, Ontology: ontology file name, Score: similarity score}
If no label is semantically similar enough return the quadruple like this:
{Label: name of label, Match: noMatch, Ontology: noMatch file name, Score: 0}

Sometimes similar labels can occur twice in the input, make sure to return one quadruple for each label in the input, for example if ten labels are provided return ten quadruples.

Remember to only return the quadruples as a response nothing else.
Complete the task with the following labels:

Here are the ontologies with which the labels need to be matched, each ontology is seperated by a line saying: Ontology (number of ontology), (name of ontology).
Use the concepts in these ontologies to map the given labels to.
